# VaultGuard

## Description

VaultGuard is a Python-based security tool designed to proactively identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within HashiCorp Vault deployments. It provides a comprehensive suite of checks covering various aspects of Vault security, including authentication methods, access control policies, secrets engine configurations, and audit logging. By automating security assessments, VaultGuard helps organizations maintain a strong security posture, reduce the risk of data breaches, and ensure compliance with industry best practices. It's designed to be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines and automated security workflows, enabling continuous monitoring and proactive remediation of security issues. This project is currently under active development and contributions are welcome.

## Features

*   **Policy Analysis:** Analyzes Vault policies for overly permissive rules or potential vulnerabilities that could lead to privilege escalation. Identifies policies granting excessive permissions to sensitive resources.

*   **Authentication Method Assessment:** Evaluates the security of configured authentication methods, such as LDAP, GitHub, and Kubernetes. Flags weak authentication configurations or insecure access patterns.

*   **Secrets Engine Configuration Auditing:** Reviews the configuration of secrets engines (e.g., KV, AWS, Database) to ensure they are properly configured and secured. Identifies potential risks associated with insecure secrets storage or access.

*   **Audit Log Monitoring:** Provides tools for analyzing Vault audit logs to detect suspicious activity or policy violations. Enables proactive identification of potential security incidents.

*   **Automated Remediation Suggestions:** Provides specific recommendations and scripts for automatically remediating identified vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

## Installation

To install VaultGuard and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/VaultGuard.git
    cd VaultGuard
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Ensure you have the `hvac` library installed.  If not, you can install it separately using `pip install hvac`.  `hvac` is the HashiCorp Vault API client for Python.

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use VaultGuard:

**1. Initialize VaultGuard and connect to Vault:**

```python
import hvac
import vaultguard.core as vg_core # Assuming the core functionality is in vaultguard/core.py

# Vault configuration
VAULT_ADDR = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"  # Replace with your Vault address
VAULT_TOKEN = "your_vault_token"  # Replace with your Vault token

# Initialize the Vault client
client = hvac.Client(url=VAULT_ADDR, token=VAULT_TOKEN)

# Verify Vault connection
if not client.sys.is_initialized():
    print("Vault is not initialized!")
    exit(1)

if not client.sys.is_authenticated():
    print("Authentication failed. Check your Vault token.")
    exit(1)

print("Successfully connected to Vault.")

# Initialize VaultGuard core module
vaultguard = vg_core.VaultGuardCore(client) # Instantiate the core class
```

**2. Example policy analysis:**

```python
# Assuming vg_core has a method to analyze policies
insecure_policies = vaultguard.analyze_policies()

if insecure_policies:
    print("Found potentially insecure policies:")
    for policy_name, details in insecure_policies.items():
        print(f"- Policy: {policy_name}")
        print(f"  Details: {details}") # Details would need to be defined in analyze_policies
else:
    print("No insecure policies found.")
```

**3. Example authentication method assessment:**

```python
# Assuming vg_core has a method to assess auth methods
auth_method_issues = vaultguard.assess_auth_methods()

if auth_method_issues:
    print("Found potential issues with authentication methods:")
    for auth_method, details in auth_method_issues.items():
        print(f"- Auth Method: {auth_method}")
        print(f"  Details: {details}") # Details would need to be defined in assess_auth_methods
else:
    print("No issues found with authentication methods.")
```

**4. Example Secrets Engine Auditing**

```python
secret_engine_issues = vaultguard.audit_secret_engines()

if secret_engine_issues:
    print("Found potential issues with secret engines:")
    for engine, details in secret_engine_issues.items():
        print(f"- Secret Engine: {engine}")
        print(f"  Details: {details}") # Details would need to be defined in audit_secret_engines
else:
    print("No issues found with secret engines.")
```

**Note:**  These examples assume the existence of methods like `analyze_policies`, `assess_auth_methods`, and `audit_secret_engines` within a `VaultGuardCore` class (or similar). You will need to implement these methods according to your specific security checks and analysis logic.  Error handling and more robust input validation should be added in a production environment.
