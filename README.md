# VaultGuard

## Description

VaultGuard is a Python-based repository dedicated to the implementation and analysis of decentralized ledger consensus algorithms. It aims to provide a practical platform for understanding the inner workings of various consensus mechanisms, their strengths, weaknesses, and performance characteristics. This project serves as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and students interested in blockchain technology and distributed systems. The implementations are designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy experimentation and modification. By providing clear, well-documented code and comprehensive analysis, VaultGuard facilitates a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles behind decentralized consensus.

## Features

*   **Modular Algorithm Implementations:** Contains implementations of various consensus algorithms, including Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Raft, and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT), designed with modularity in mind for easy comparison and extension.
*   **Performance Analysis Tools:** Provides tools and scripts for simulating and analyzing the performance of different consensus algorithms under varying network conditions and workloads. This includes metrics such as transaction throughput, latency, and fault tolerance.
*   **Configurable Network Simulation:** Allows for the creation of simulated network environments with customizable parameters, such as network latency, packet loss, and node distribution, enabling realistic testing scenarios.
*   **Visualization and Reporting:** Offers visualization tools to represent the behavior and performance of consensus algorithms, along with reporting capabilities to generate detailed analysis reports.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Designed with an extensible architecture, allowing users to easily add new consensus algorithms and analysis tools.

## Installation

To install VaultGuard and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/VaultGuard.git
    cd VaultGuard
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following dependencies (example):

    ```
    networkx==2.8.8
    matplotlib==3.6.2
    numpy==1.23.4
    psutil==5.9.4
    python-dotenv==0.21.0
    ```

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use VaultGuard:

**Example 1: Running a Proof-of-Work simulation:**

Assuming you have an implementation of Proof-of-Work in `consensus/pow.py` and a simulation script in `simulations/pow_simulation.py`:

```python
# simulations/pow_simulation.py
from consensus.pow import ProofOfWork
from network.network_simulator import NetworkSimulator

def main():
    # Configuration parameters
    num_nodes = 5
    block_size = 1024  # bytes
    difficulty = 4      # Number of leading zeros required

    # Initialize the network simulator
    network = NetworkSimulator(num_nodes=num_nodes, latency_mean=50, latency_std=10)

    # Initialize Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism
    pow_consensus = ProofOfWork(difficulty=difficulty)

    # Simulate the network and consensus process
    for i in range(10):  # Simulate 10 blocks
        new_block = f"Block data {i}".encode('utf-8')
        miner_node = i % num_nodes  # Rotate miner
        network.nodes[miner_node].generate_block(new_block, pow_consensus)

        # Optionally, broadcast the new block to the network
        # for node in network.nodes:
        #    if node != network.nodes[miner_node]:
        #        node.receive_block(new_block)

    # Analyze the results
    print("Simulation completed.")
    # Add code here to analyze block propagation times, chain length, etc.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run this simulation:

```bash
python simulations/pow_simulation.py
```

**Example 2: Implementing a simple Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validator:**

```python
# consensus/pos.py
import random

class ProofOfStake:
    def __init__(self, initial_stake={}):
        self.stakes = initial_stake  # Dictionary of node IDs to stake amounts
        self.total_stake = sum(self.stakes.values())

    def select_validator(self):
        """Selects a validator node based on its stake."""
        if not self.stakes:
            return None  # No validators

        # Calculate probabilities based on stake
        probabilities = [stake / self.total_stake for stake in self.stakes.values()]

        # Select a validator using weighted random choice
        validators = list(self.stakes.keys())
        return random.choices(validators, weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]

    def update_stake(self, node_id, stake_amount):
        """Updates the stake for a given node."""
        self.stakes[node_id] = stake_amount
        self.total_stake = sum(self.stakes.values())

# Example Usage in a simulation script (simulations/pos_simulation.py)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize stakes
    initial_stakes = {
        "node1": 100,
        "node2": 200,
        "node3": 50
    }

    pos = ProofOfStake(initial_stakes)

    # Select a validator
    validator = pos.select_validator()
    print(f"Selected validator: {validator}")

    # Update stake
    pos.update_stake("node1", 150)
    print(f"Updated validator selection: {pos.select_validator()}")
```

To run the Proof-of-Stake example:

```bash
python simulations/pos_simulation.py
```

These examples provide a basic understanding of how to use the different components of VaultGuard.  Further details and more complex examples can be found in the project's documentation and example scripts.
